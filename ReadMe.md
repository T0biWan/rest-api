# REST API

This is a simple skeleton to build RESTful APIs with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), and [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/). It is based on a [tutorial](https://hackernoon.com/restful-api-design-with-node-js-26ccf66eab09) by Adnan RahiÄ‡ at [hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/). I changed it to fit my needs and style. To implement your own API just change the example files provided in the _api_-directory and hook up your database.

## Setup

```
npm install
# start db
npm run dev # for nodemon
npm run start
```
